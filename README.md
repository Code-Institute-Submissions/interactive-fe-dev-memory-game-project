# Simon Inspireed Game

I created this game inspired by the well known Simon game. Added a few new functionalities but the 
main logic of the game is the same.

### Research

After deciding to build this game for my second Milestone Project I made some research online to get a better
understanding on how this game works. Saw many different ways on how to write the logic for the game and that helped a 
lot to decide on how i want to bulid my game. 

### Wireframes

    I drew my wireframe on Figma.com. There are minor differences between the wireframe and the actual game.
